          <p class="text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif"><b>Project Overview:</b><br>A small group of designers pose a question: How might we internally collaborate more effectively in order to deliver high quality design materials? In an effort to continue optimal design output despite working remotely, the team set out with the goal of creating and rolling out a design critique process that NCR designers find accessible and valuable. The project began by outlining current processes that have historically seen a low adoption rate. We then gathered insights on designer needs before, during and after a critique. Once these needs were identified, we assembled an objective critique guide derived from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-critiques/">Nielsen Norman Group's Design Critique Guide <a/> for both presenters and participants. Once the guide was developed, we began addressing the tactical requirements:<br><br><br>
              
              1. Scheduling Alignment Tool<br>
              2. Dedicated Communication Outlet<br>
              3. Attendee Participation Sign-up Tool<br>
              4. Centralized and Collaborative Critique Tool<br><br><br>
       
              The team evaluated various tools and platforms to address the above needs. Once tools were vetted and selected, we scheduled and conducted a pilot critique session to gather feedback and iterate on the process for a second pilot. The new design critique process is slated to roll out Q1 2021. This is an internal company process. In order to respect NCR IP, please inquire for more in-depth details. <br><br>

          <p class="text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif"><b>Project Overview:</b><br>As the self-checkout user experience lead at NCR, I needed to understand the legacy system in place and form a baseline for measuring success for a new generation design. In order to do this, I worked alongside researchers to initiate an audit on the legacy system. Because there was no research informing the legacy design, each component of the system required a usability evaluation. Once the benchmark study was conducted, we were able to identify the high and low performing areas of the system. We are now leveraging this baseline to measure against a new next generation prototype design. As an added usability measure, a content audit was performed to groom syntax and general linguistic obstructions. The goal of the content audit was to ensure a match between the system and the real world – a heuristic identified in <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen Norman Group's 10 Usability Heuristics.</a> This redesign is an ongoing effort at NCR, with the new UI to be released Q2 2021. New designs are not yet available to the public. In order to respect NCR IP, please inquire for more in-depth design details.<br><br>

      <hr class="divider my-6">
         <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 justify-content-center" ><br>
          <p class="text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">I began my journey at Pursuant Health as a visual designer with a strong interest in user-centered design. With the guidance and support of my mentor, Ryan Sloan, I began to advocate for a significantly stronger focus on the importance of the user experience in the organization. Due to the lean business environment, it was critical that I supported our product and marketing efforts in addition to remediating the existing user experience. After a few years of supporting both efforts, I was able to transition the product and marketing initiatives to individual self-sustaining departments.<br><br>

In 2017, I shifted my attention to personal and professional development and growth. I carefully researched opportunities through which I could advance within the HCI field with a more meaningful and expansive skillset. After seeking advice and guidance from HCI leaders and various department heads at Georgia Tech, I established a goal: Apply for admittance into the Georgia Tech Masters in Human Computer Interaction upcoming Fall 2018 class – and I got in!<br><br>

              
In the fall of 2018 I began to devote my time and efforts to user experience initiatives at Pursuant Health, while working diligently in the Georgia Tech MS HCI program.

In January 2019, I successfully made the case for an official User Experience department within the company. We approached our design problems with a phased strategy (MVP) based on our development resource constraints. With a focus on design thinking and full support from the management team, we implemented a new design process:<br><br>

1. Research/Understand <br>
2. Wireframe/Sketch (feedback)<br>
3. Design <br>
4. Test <br>
5. Analyze <br>
6. Repeat<br>

The National Federation of the Blind expressed accessibility concerns with respect to visually impaired users. This scope would create an accessible user experience (the “Inclusive Experience”) for the visually impaired as well as those with auditory and mobility impairments for both the web and kiosk environments.<br><br>

Current users receive health assessment information through the kiosks located in Walmart Pharmacies and through the member website. Kiosk users utilize the kiosk independently or with the assistance of locally trained staff (i.e. pharmacists in store locations) or by contacting dedicated support service staff. Support services team can remotely walk a user through an assessment and provide real-time results to the user.
<br><br>
Project required new hardware and external accessibility experts to guide and teach technology and user experience team to design and implement accessible experiences. This project spanned two years, and consisted of studying user experience best practices with accessibility experts (one of which was totally blind).
<br><br>
<b>Project Goals:</b><br><br>
              
Mitigate accessibility issues for the following user types:
<ul class="text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">

  <li>Blind</li>
  <li>Mobility Impaired</li>
  <li>Hearing Impaired</li>

  <li>Allow a user to launch an “Inclusive Experience” that will allow the user to access the kiosk capabilities of Blood Pressure, Weight and Vison Assessments with minimal interaction with the touch screen.</li><br>
  <li>The Inclusive Experience will contain guided audio instructions that guide the user through the experience.</li><br>
  <li>The Inclusive Experience allows the user to obtain Biometric Measurements (“Results”) by means of audio feedback (as opposed to onscreen display).</li><br>
  <li>The Inclusive Experience includes the ability to navigate the experience using an assistive audio navigator tactile keypad. This assistive keypad device offers menu navigation by means of audio direction. Users with impaired vision, reading difficulties or impaired fine motor skills can navigate through menus or directories that would typically be presented on a visual display or touch screen. Screen content is presented and summarized by recorded or synthesized language via a headset or handset.

The user’s results are reported as a numerical score indicating low- or high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Those identified as high-risk are encouraged to speak with their doctor to learn more about ways to help reduce their risk or delay the onset of diabetes.

The latest diabetes statistics indicate that more than 8 million American adults have diabetes and don’t know it. Another 86 million American adults—more than one in three—have pre-diabetes, which means that their blood glucose (sugar) is higher than normal, yet not high enough to meet the criteria for diabetes. These statistics demonstrate a critical need for Americans to be informed about their health status and risks for type 2 diabetes.<br><br>

1.	Simple and intuitive assessment on kiosk environment <br>
2.	Inform users of potential risk for Type II diabetes based on self-attested inputs and non-invasive biometric measurements using the ADA’s proprietary algorithm<br>
3.	Display risk level for type II diabetes<br><br>

          <p class="text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes is the leading cause of blindness. “Over time, high blood sugar levels from diabetes lead to damage of the retina, the layer on the back of the eye that captures images and sends them to the brain. Eye damage can be occurring without any initial symptoms. That is why it is so important for people with diabetes to get regular eye examinations and catch problems before serious retinal changes occur.” Because diabetic retinopathy impacts up to 85% of individuals with diabetes, the ability to increase the total number of screenings can significantly reduce instances of preventable blindness and overall healthcare costs simultaneously. The ability to utilize a self-service health kiosk to capture retinal images, coordinate with eye specialists for processing and report results back to primary care physicians in the most convenient way possible has the power to transform how healthcare is delivered.

<br><br>“The [system], developed by ophthalmologist Kevin Lavery, contains a non-mydriatic exam that does not require dilation. Upon the exam’s completion, an eye care provider, currently part of a network of board certified ophthalmologists, will evaluate the images, which are encrypted and sent electronically via secure HIPAA-compliant software.”<br><br>
