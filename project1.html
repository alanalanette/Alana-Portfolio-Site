          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
              
              As the design lead for a global employee support experience transformation initiative at EY, I eliminated barriers and challenges in traditional, technology-led support experiences. By conducting extensive user research and leveraging telemetry, Service Now, and survey data, we designed and delivered a new support experience optimized for ease of use, speed, and efficiency. The results were impressive, with significant reductions in support costs, ticket volume, and improvements in employee productivity and satisfaction. The initiative also improved the agent experience by introducing automation and reducing repetitive requests, allowing them to focus on high-value interactions.
              
              <br>
              In support of the program, the UXD and UXR team engaged on a project to inform the information architecture of the Service Now Self-Service Portal Catalog. To ensure that our work was grounded in evidence and aligned with user mental models, my research partner, and I conducted a rigorous qualitative free text analysis. This analysis was carried out using a framework that we developed and delivered to our analytics team to extrapolate and identify patterns.

             <h2 class="text-left mt-0">Methodology and Limitations</h2>          
            <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif"> 
            Free text analysis is a valuable technique for designers and researchers to comprehend and classify different concepts within a given domain. It involves analyzing and organizing unstructured text data, providing insights into how people perceive and discuss information.  <br><br>
                
           By conducting a free text analysis, designers can better understand how users perceive and structure information, which can lead to more intuitive and user-friendly information architectures. In this study, we focused on the short description field in Service Now self-service ticket submissions, identifying common themes, topics, and patterns using the free text analysis technique.<br><br>
                
            To enhance the effectiveness of this qualitative effort, we identified the top 10 ticket requests globally based on Service Now ticket volume data. For each request type, we collected and organized the free text extracted from the short description field, viewing between 30-50 tickets for each category in each country. In some countries, alternate categories were selected due to the absence of a specific catalog item.<br><br>
                
                
            It is important to note that this method is purely qualitative in nature and does not provide statistically significant insights. The goal of this analysis was to establish high-level catalog item naming guidelines and to provide a framework for the analytics team to extrapolate.<br><br>
            
                 <h2 class="text-left mt-0">Process</h2>          
            <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif"> 
          To begin our analysis, we collected free text data from the top 10 catalog item form submissions with the highest monthly volume, and categorized by ticket category using distinct sticky note colors for each country. <br><br>
              
            
     <div class="image-container">
  <img src="img/portfolio/fullsize/FTA_1.webp" style= "max-width: 100%" alt="A series of boards arranged by country with ticket category organized">
 
</div>

           <br><br>
            <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif"> 
      We organized the colored-coded free text data stickies into corresponding ticket category boards, and performed a clustering analysis by identifying patterns in users' language usage, such as their use of descriptors like "broken," "not working," or "doesn't work" to describe malfunctions, or the verbs they use, such as "grant access" or "provide access." Additionally, we observed color concentration representing different countries. Based on this analysis, we were able to group the data into meaningful categories.
                <br><br>
              
      <div>
  <span style="display:inline-block; position:relative;">
    <img class="img-fluid col-lg-4 col-sm-6" style= "max-width: 100%" src="img/portfolio/fullsize/FTA_2.webp" alt="A series of boards arranged by country with ticket category organized" style="width: 100%;">
  </span>
</div>
              

        <br><br>
                    <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif"> 

             We then created a board that focused on the subject of each ticket category. Using this board, we began clustering naming variances and identifying commonalities. Additionally, by examining the variation and concentration of colors, we were able to determine whether a term was more globally or regionally used. For instance, we found that "laptop" was a globally common term when referring to computers, followed by "computer" and "PC" as the second and third most frequent terms, respectively. This helped us create aliases for improved search result accuracy. We utilized this information to recommend catalog item naming for top items and create a framework for supporting search result accuracy through the use of alias terms. This approach is highly flexible and can be customized to meet the specific needs of different information architecture projects.<br><br>
              
                                        
   <div>
  <span style="display:inline-block; position:relative;">
    <img class="img-fluid col-lg-4 col-sm-6" style= "max-width: 100%" src="img/portfolio/fullsize/FTA_3.webp" alt="A series of boards arranged by country with ticket category organized" style="width: 100%;">

        <h2 class="text-left mt-0">Insights Summary</h2>
                <br><br>
                
               <h5 class="text-left mt-0">Intune Company Portal</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
Considering the prevalence of tickets received for both "Intune" and "Company Portal", we suggest combining the two names for better coverage of commonly used language, resulting in "Intune Company Portal".

 <br><br>
              
                <h5 class="text-left mt-0">Microsoft Teams</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
Although both "Teams" and "MS Teams" were used in the same number of countries, "Teams" was more commonly used by individuals. However, "MS Teams" is a strong keyword.

   <br><br>
            
              
                 <h5 class="text-left mt-0">Microsoft Outlook</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
In most cases, people referred to the product as "Outlook" without including "MS" or "Microsoft." Similar to how people referred to "Teams," they also used product functions like "Email" and "Calendar" to describe issues. These words would be great as keywords and for bot training.

   <br><br>

      <h5 class="text-left mt-0">EY Remote Connect</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
There was a lot of variation in how people referred to EY's remote connection software, but "EY Remote Connect" is the most complete and accurate name. Most variations included a combination of "EY," "Remote," and "Connect." Because VPN usage is high in India, the USA, and China (all high-volume ticket countries), "VPN" should be an essential keyword.
              
                 <br><br>

      <h5 class="text-left mt-0">RSA / SecurID</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
"RSA / SecurID" was not the most frequently used single term, but it was common across multiple countries and combines the two most common terms, "RSA token" and "SecurID," into one for better coverage. See the list of other phrases captured for how often "RSA" and "SecurID" were used in variations, and for keyword and bot training options. Other common terms include "Software Token," "RSA Hardware Token," "RSA Software Token," "SecurID Token," "SecurID VPN," "Token App," "Access Token," "RSA Security Token," "RSA Token Generator," "RSA Portal," "Security Token," "Secure Token," and "RSA code."

              
                 <br><br>
              
              
      <h5 class="text-left mt-0">Mercury Timesheet</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
"Mercury Timesheet" was not the most frequently used single term, but it was common across multiple countries and combines the two most common terms, "Mercury" and "Timesheet," into one for better coverage.
              
                 <br><br>
              
              
             <h5 class="text-left mt-0">EY AppStore</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              
There were a few different variations in capitalization and spacing for "EY AppStore," which should be considered when creating keywords and for bot training:

              
              <ul class="text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
  <li>EY app store</li>
  <li>EY appstore</li>
  <li>EY Appstore</li>
  <li>EY AppStore</li>
  <li>EY AppStore</li>


</ul>
              
                 <br><br>
                  
                          
      <h5 class="text-left mt-0">EY Canvas</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              

Although "EY Canvas" was not as widely used as just "Canvas," it includes "Canvas," so all issues should be covered by the proper name of "EY Canvas."

              
                 <br><br>
              
                                        
      <h5 class="text-left mt-0">Phone</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              

All references to "Phone" were related to installing Intune and other apps, so it is clear they were not talking about a desk phone.

              
                 <br><br>
              
              <h5 class="text-left mt-0">Laptop</h5>
          <p class= "text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
              

"Laptop" was overwhelmingly the most commonly used term. However, there were instances where people referred only to the part of the device causing the issue, such as "Battery," "Keyboard," "Camera," "Mouse," "Headphones," and "Charger."
              
                           <ul class="text-dark mb-4" style= "font-family: sans-serif">
  <li>Battery</li>
  <li>Keyboard</li>
  <li>Camera</li>
  <li>Mouse</li>
  <li>Headphones</li>
  <li>Charger</li>
                               
</ul>
